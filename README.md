# Simon Says Style Game

Hi, in this tutorial we will make a Simon Says style using windows form and C# programming. This game was a fun problem to solve as it required some out of the box thinking. In the beginning the idea was simple the game picks 3 blocks from the screen on 4×4 grid. We save the sequence and we need to blink those blocks to change colour in the same sequence so the user will know which box the game picked. First problem to solve was how to save the sequence information for the player and the game also we needed to figure out how to do the blink animation for the picture boxes. It was challenging but the solution turned out how to be more simple than the problem. We wanted to strictly use 1 timer in the game so this way we don’t need to keep starting and stopping multiple timers in the form so in this game we will use one timer but keep track of the blinking animation using a simple switch statement. Also we managed to make the game so when you score 3 it will level up by one so the game becomes more challenging the more you play it. We hope you find this tutorial useful and also you can make a lot more projects using the similar methods as this tutorial. Keep learning and keep making things.
